# Applications

### [Actions Runner Controller](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/deploying-runner-scale-sets-with-actions-runner-controller#runner-scale-set)
Actions Runner Controller (ARC) is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions. With ARC, you can create runner scale sets that automatically scale based on the number of workflows running in your repository, organization, or enterprise. Because controlled runners can be ephemeral and based on containers, new runner instances can scale up or down rapidly and cleanly.

### [Actual](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual)
Actual is a local-first personal finance tool. It is 100% free and open-source, written in NodeJS, it has a synchronization element so that all your changes can move between devices without any heavy lifting.

### [Cert-Manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager)
Cert-manager is a X.509 certificate manager for Kubernetes. It adds multiple certificate and issuer resources to your cluster can help you automate obtaininig, renewing, and using your certificates. By using the [DNS challenge](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#setting-nameservers-for-dns01-self-check) option we can obtain certificates even for an internal-only domain name. Cert-manager knows that you still control the domain since it can write TXT records back to Cloudflare with your API token. If you have an internal DNS server and use [split-horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS) be sure to add the extraAgs shown above to force cert-manager to use public DNS to authenticate since your internal DNS will not propogate those records.

### [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium)
Cilium is an open source, cloud native solution for providing, securing, and observing network connectivity between workloads, fueled by the revolutionary Kernel technology eBPF

### [Cloudflare-DDNS](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns)
A feature-rich and robust Cloudflare DDNS updater with a small footprint. The program will detect your machineâ€™s public IP addresses and update DNS records using the [Cloudflare API](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

### [CloudNative Postgres Operator](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg)
CloudNativePG is a comprehensive open source platform designed to seamlessly manage PostgreSQL databases within Kubernetes environments, covering the entire operational lifecycle from initial deployment to ongoing maintenance. The main component is the CloudNativePG operator. Deploy a Postgres `Cluster` to [define your deployment](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.25/cloudnative-pg.v1/#Cluster).
```
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
  namespace: default
spec:
  instances: 3
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```

### [CSI Driver NFS](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs)
This driver allows Kubernetes to access NFS servers on both Linux and Windows nodes, plugin name: `nfs.csi.k8s.io`.

### [CSI Driver SMB](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-smb)
This driver allows Kubernetes to access SMB servers on both Linux and Windows nodes, plugin name: `smb.csi.k8s.io`.

### [Flux Extensions](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/)
- [Monitoring Alerts](https://fluxcd.io/flux/monitoring/alerts/) - This guide will help you setup alerts that use the notification controller. Many Flux `kind`s can be monitored and send alerts based on state changes or errors. Cross-namespace references are difficult (by design) so I've done a single secret in `flux-system` as well as the provider which references it. The alert can point to objects in other namespaces so this removes the need for replicating resources across namespaces.
- [Webhook Receivers](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/webhook-receivers/) - With cert-manager installed and the ability to create certificates for custom domains, we can turn Flux into a push-based pipeline that will trigger a sync any time there's a commit.

### [GPU Operator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator)
Kubernetes provides access to special hardware resources such as NVIDIA GPUs, NICs, Infiniband adapters and other devices through the device plugin framework. However, configuring and managing nodes with these hardware resources requires configuration of multiple software components such as drivers, container runtimes or other libraries which are difficult and prone to errors. The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the operator framework within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision GPU. These components include the NVIDIA drivers (to enable CUDA), Kubernetes device plugin for GPUs, the NVIDIA Container Runtime, automatic node labelling, DCGM based monitoring and others.

### [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)
Grafana lets you query, visualize, alert on, and explore your metrics, logs, and traces wherever they're stored. This install is a part of the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) which is helpful for monitoring a K8S cluster. It comes with many helpful default dashboards. The default credentials for this install is `admin`/`prom-operator`.

### [Headlamp](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/headlamp)
Headlamp is an easy-to-use and extensible Kubernetes web UI.

### [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core)
Home Assistant is a home automation toolkit that lets you automate and control your home. Changes to `configuration.yaml` are required if you want to place Home Assistant behind a proxy. When doing the first-time install, disable the mount that maps the configmap to the pod. Let the deployment create the directory and necessary files first, then reconfigure the deployment to use your configmap which can be updated as needed. Reloader will take care of restarting it if you do any further configuration changes. Use `ws://localhost:3000` for the web-socket address in the z-wave integration instead of the detected IP address since the pod IP can change with restarts.

### [Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage)
A modern, fully static, fast, secure fully proxied, highly customizable application dashboard with integrations for over 100 services and translations into multiple languages. Easily configured via YAML files or through docker label discovery.

### [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie-recipes/mealie/)
Mealie is a self-hosted recipe manager, meal planner, and shopping list application.

### [MetalLB](https://github.com/metallb/metallb)
Bare-metal Kubernetes installs do not have a native load-balancer implementation. This tool lets you dedicate IP addresses to be available to your cluster for [Services of type LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/) to claim for use. I'll set one address aside specifically for a reverse-proxy to use with a DNS name, and I'll have another small pool available for other random stuff. See [basic L2 configuration](https://metallb.io/configuration/) to get started.

### [Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server)
Metrics Server is a scalable, efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes built-in autoscaling pipelines. Publishes resource usage to enable `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` and `VerticalPodAutoscaler`.

### [MySpeed](https://github.com/gnmyt/myspeed/)
Test analysis software that records your internet speed for up to 30 days.

### [Node Feature Discovery](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-feature-discovery)
Node Feature Discovery is an addon to detect node capabilities for Kubernetes. It detects hardware features available on each node in a Kubernetes cluster, and advertises those features using node labels and optionally node extended resources, annotations and node taints. Node Feature Discovery is compatible with any recent version of Kubernetes (v1.24+).

### [Ping Server](https://github.com/homelab-peej/ping-server)
A basic app with busybox that listens at :8080/ping to use for random debugging.

### [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
Prometheus is a great systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It's the datasource that is used by Grafana to display your cluster statistics and information. This install is a part of the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) which is helpful for monitoring a K8S cluster.

### [Reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector)
Reflector is a Kubernetes addon designed to monitor changes to resources (`secret` and `configmap`) and reflect changes to mirror resources in the same or other namespaces.

### [Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/reloader)
Reloader will watch many resources for `ConfigMap` or `Secret` changes and automatically rollout an update for those changes. Simply add the annotation `reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"` to your Deployment `.metadata`. See the [documentation](https://github.com/stakater/reloader#how-to-use-reloader) for more examples.

### [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)
Renovate is an automated dependency update tool. It helps to update dependencies in your code without needing to do it manually. When Renovate runs on your repo, it looks for references to dependencies (both public and private) and, if there are newer versions available, Renovate can create pull requests to update your versions automatically.

### [Spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel)
Spegel enables each node in a Kubernetes cluster to act as a local registry mirror, allowing nodes to share images between themselves. Any image already pulled by a node will be available for any other node in the cluster to pull. This has the benefit of reducing workload startup times and egress traffic as images will be stored locally within the cluster. On top of that it allows the scheduling of new workloads even when external registries are down.

### [System Upgrade Controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller)
This project aims to provide a general-purpose, Kubernetes-native upgrade controller (for nodes). It introduces a new CRD, the `Plan`, for defining any and all of your upgrade policies/requirements. A `Plan` is an outstanding intent to mutate nodes in your cluster. This is the recommended way to automate K3S updates according to the [documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/upgrades/automated).

### [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik)
Traefik is an ingress controller that will let you access services with DNS names and a standard port across all services. To setup your service with Traefik, define a service type of `ClusterIP` with the `.spec.ports.port` your application is exposing. Then define a Kubernetes Ingress that points to your service. You can update your hosts file on a local system if you'd like to resolve a name to an IP address. If you have a DNS server, you can configure A records such as `homelab.local` and `*.homelab.local` that point to the IP address Traefik is running on. If you have a public domain name, you can do the same on your public DNS provider and then port-forward your router to Traefik to access services remotely.

### [Unpoller](https://github.com/unpoller/unpoller)
Unpoller will pull data from Unifi sources through a service account. Data can be exported to InfluxDB or Prometheus for viewing in Grafana. There are some preconfigured dashboards available for import referenced in the Unpoller [docs](https://unpoller.com/docs/install/grafana#dashboard-installation-instructions).

### [Z-Wave JS UI](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-ui)
Z-Wave control panel and MQTT gateway. Either can be enabled separately or both together. I've paired this with Home Assistant so I can control z-wave switches and outlets around the home via [this dongle](https://a.co/d/9HZfxjH). By running this in the same pod as Home Assistant, it's still accessible from HA via localhost and keeps the services and ingresses simple.
